# 💖 BambiBrowser — Sissy Edition 💖

Welcome, sweetie.

This little guide explains how your adorable BambiBrowser setup works. It's simple, automatic, and designed so you barely have to lift a finger. Just follow the steps and let everything take over when it's time.

## 🌸 1. Install Your Extension

- Open your browser (chromium based).
- Go to one of these:
  - `chrome://extensions/`
  - `edge://extensions/`
  - `brave://extensions/`
  - `opera://extensions/`
  - `any_chromium_browser://extensions/`
- Turn on **Developer Mode**.
- Click **Load unpacked**.
- Select the folder named: `extension`

Your browser is now ready to behave for you.

## 🌸 2. Start the Bambi Player

Double-click: `BambiPlayer.exe`

A tiny tray icon will appear. That means your helper is awake and waiting quietly in the background.

No windows, no popups — it just sits there, ready to take control.

## 🌸 3. Visit HypnoTube

Go to: https://hypnotube.com

You don't need to click anything special. Your extension already knows what to do.

## 🌸 4. What Happens Automatically

Whenever you open a video on HypnoTube:

- The extension detects the main video.
- It checks if BambiPlayer is running.

**If it is:**
- The browser video pauses
- The video URL is sent to BambiPlayer
- VLC opens fullscreen
- Input lock activates
- You watch without touching anything
- When the video ends:
  - VLC closes
  - Input lock releases
  - Everything returns to normal

**If BambiPlayer is not running:**
- The browser just plays the video normally
- No fullscreen hijack
- No lock

## 🌸 5. How to Stop the Bambi Player

Right-click the tray icon → **Quit**.

This instantly disables hijacking until you run it again.

## 🌸 6. That's Everything, Sweetie

No setup pages. No popups. No buttons. No fuss.

Just automatic fullscreen hijack whenever your helper is running.

You browse normally — and when the moment comes, everything slips into Bambi Mode without you doing a thing.
